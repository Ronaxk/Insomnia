            <h3><a href="#"><i>What is Insomnia?</i></a></h3>
            <p>Insomnia, also known as sleeplessness, is a sleep disorder in which people have trouble sleeping. They may have difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep as long as desired. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. It may result in an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions, as well as problems focusing and learning. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month.

Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, restless leg syndrome, menopause, certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Other risk factors include working night shifts and sleep apnea. Diagnosis is based on sleep habits and an examination to look for underlying causes. A sleep study may be done to look for underlying sleep disorders. Screening may be done with two questions: "do you experience difficulty sleeping?" and "do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep?"According to Centers for disease control and prevention,
adults need at least 7-9 hours of sleep in every 24 hour
period, depending on their age. Insomnia is a sleep
disorder that regularly effects millions of people
Worldwide. Someone
with insomnia find its difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep.
About a third of all adults reports some insomnia
symptoms. 6 to 10% of adults have symptoms severe
enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia
disorder.
